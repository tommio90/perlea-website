    "role": "Founder, freight-tech startup, Series A in 11 weeks",
    "context": "Extremely time-pressured. Has seen 100 landing pages. Deeply skeptical of learning platforms \u2014 burned by ones that didn't lead to shipping. Has $1.2M raised, domain expertise, but can't code. Evaluating in 30 seconds.",
    "primary_concern": "Can this actually help me demo something for Series A investors in 8 weeks?",
    "tolerance": "Very low. Bounces instantly if it feels generic or slow."
